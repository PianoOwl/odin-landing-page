            <h2>Well-done steak? Are you kidding me? That's like turning a beautiful piece of art into a pile of ash. A true chef knows that a steak should be seared to perfection on a high heat, then left to rest like a boss, so the juices can redistribute throughout the meat. Serving it well-done is an insult to the cow and a crime against good food. If that's what you want, go to a fast food joint, but don't expect any respect from me. <span>-Gordon Ramsay</span></h2>
